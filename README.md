### 1. cite.py  
- hang_ind will apply hanging indentation to the reference list in a docx. Pandoc cannot apply hanging indentation if you create a docx file from markdown (at least not January 2018). This function will do that. Only use it if the reference list is the last section in your docx!  
- bib_modify will apply correct capitalization (Apa6th) to titles that are stored in a bib file 

### 2. string_op.py
- s_replace screens a file for a regex and replaces matches by given string.
