# Own

This repository contains modules that I wrote for my own workflow or that haven been created for exercise purposes. You should ignore the exercise content. But maybe you find some of the modules at the top useful for your own workflow. I am always happy for feedback for improvement:

## Python Modules

### 1. cite.py  
- hang_ind will apply hanging indentation to the reference list in a word document. Pandoc cannot apply hanging indentation if you create a docx file from markdown (at least not January 2018). This function will do that. Only use it if the reference list is the last section in your docx! 
- bib_modify will apply correct capitalization (Apa6th) to titles that are stored in a bib file 

### 2. string_op.py
- s_replace screens a file for a regex and replaces matches by given string.
